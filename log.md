# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Starting a project to implement basic DataStructure on C++

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with data structure and normally I just understand the concept but not how it implement. Overall, it's great opportunity to start working on it from scratch and improve it when I get the grip on it.
