# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Starting a project to implement basic DataStructure on C++

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with data structure and normally I just understand the concept but not how it implement. Overall, it's great opportunity to start working on it from scratch and improve it when I get the grip on it.

### Day 2: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Restructure Linked-list, Added Stack and Queue class

**Thoughts:** Starting to get the grip on how to use template, as I'm not normally apply template while working. Basic functions of linked list and stack are there, will add on more functionality in coming days. Queue has some bug on enqueue and dequeue will look into it tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring Linked-list (Part1) and Queue class

**Thoughts:** Basic structure for linked-list is quite important as many of others data structure implementation could reuse linked-list class. Queue class crashed yesterday has been fixed today, but linked-list class structure still have some bug on it. Will look into that tomorrow.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring Linked-list (Part2), Stack and Queue class

**Thoughts:** Feel accomplishment when the queue class could implement using two stack class and getting familiar with template specialization on class and function. Today also been try to implement the stack class using linked-list class too. The backbone of the structure is really important.

### Day 5: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring Linked-list (Part3), Added Hash Table structure

**Thoughts:** Trying to implement hash table class using template, somehow it doesn't work well. So, implement it with string input first and improve it when I got idea to do so.

### Day 6: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reading and implemented Binary Tree class

**Thoughts:** Still confused with some of terms describe in tree data structure, will read more on it tomorrow. Today was kinda rush, not much time to do more coding and reading.

### Day 7: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Reading and implemented more functions for Binary Tree class

**Thoughts:** Understand more terms in tree structure but still confused a lot with the implement on traversal and recursion. Will read more in coming days to be familiar and understand how it really work.

**Link to work:** [Data Structure](https://github.com/seancyw/DataStructure/commit/1434584ffcda78d2c2ba894ada0d2ddaa856bf20)

### Day 8: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed wrong node delete in pop function for Binary Tree class

**Thoughts:** Resistance today, doesn't have much focus on study for the tree. So, instead fix for the bug in the class. I must overcome the resistance.

### Day 9: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed compile error in levelOrderTraversal function and make better test case for Binary Tree class 

**Thoughts:** Was planning to fix the bug on stack destructor but doesn't work well. Anyhow, the bug in binary tree class is solved. Somehow, it seems that I still doesn't know a lots of stuff. The more I code, the more I'm lost.

### Day 10: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added destroyTree, search and method to check if tree is a binary search tree

**Thoughts:** Want to implement another structure but does not have much time to read up on it, so add more functionality to tree class before proceeding. In coming days, will spend more time on reading on others data strucure like graph, AVL tree, n-Ary tree if time is allowed.

### Day 11: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added functions to get successor and predecessor of a given node (Binary Tree) class

**Thoughts:** Reading on graph structure will implement it in coming days. Need more practice in tree recursion and traversal concept, it could be confusing sometimes.

### Day 14: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added more functions (addVertex, addEdges, isLinkBetweenVertex, getAdjacentVertex) for Graph

**Thoughts:** Trying to implement the graph adjacent list using own method even though the space-time performance not perfect. Will improve it further when I code it down the road.

### Day 15: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Complete doubly linked-list implementation

**Thoughts:** Finished what the task left off 3 days ago which is completing doubly linked-list. Was stuck initially because wrong concept and code without thinking (same old problem), manage to google information on wikipedia and finish it using pseudocode provides.

### Day 16: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added skeleton class for Heap data structure and Reading on Heap data structure
