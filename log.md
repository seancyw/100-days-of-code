# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Starting a project to implement basic DataStructure on C++

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with data structure and normally I just understand the concept but not how it implement. Overall, it's great opportunity to start working on it from scratch and improve it when I get the grip on it.

### Day 2: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Restructure Linked-list, Added Stack and Queue class

**Thoughts:** Starting to get the grip on how to use template, as I'm not normally apply template while working. Basic functions of linked list and stack are there, will add on more functionality in coming days. Queue has some bug on enqueue and dequeue will look into it tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring Linked-list and Queue class

**Thoughts:** Basic structure for linked-list is quite important as many of others data structure implementation could reuse linked-list class. Queue class crashed yesterday has been fixed today, but linked-list class structure still have some bug on it. Will look into that tomorrow.
